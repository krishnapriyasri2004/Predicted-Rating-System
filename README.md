# Predicted-Rating-System
This comprehensive Python script delves into the realm of machine learning to analyze and predict product ratings based on various factors. It utilizes **several techniques,** including **linear regression, artificial neural networks, random forests, and K-means clustering,** to uncover hidden patterns and relationships within a dataset. The script effectively handles outliers, evaluates model performance, and generates insightful recommendations.
**Key Features:**
Exploratory Data Analysis: Unveils the characteristics of the dataset through descriptive statistics, null value detection, and unique value identification.
Outlier Removal:Employs the interquartile range (IQR) method to identify and eliminate outliers, ensuring data integrity.
**Machine Learning Techniques:**
Linear Regression:Establishes a linear relationship between product ratings and numerical features (Amount and Qty) using linear regression.
Artificial Neural Network (ANN): Imploys an ANN to model the complex nonlinear relationship between product ratings and features.
Random Forest:Leverages the power of random forests to capture complex interactions between features and predict product ratings effectively.
K-means Clustering: Segments the dataset into meaningful clusters based on product characteristics (Amount and Qty), revealing underlying patterns.
Model Evaluation:Assesses the performance of each machine learning model using the R-squared score for linear regression and classification accuracy for ANN and random forest.
Correlation Analysis:Uncovers correlations between features using a heatmap, providing insights into feature relationships.
Recommendation Analysis: Identifies top-rated products based on predicted ratings, generated using the best-performing machine learning model.
Data Visualization: Employs scatter plots and histograms to visualize product ratings, explore relationships between features and ratings, and gain insights from K-means clustering.

This script demonstrates a comprehensive approach to machine learning for product rating prediction, offering valuable insights into consumer behavior and preferences.
